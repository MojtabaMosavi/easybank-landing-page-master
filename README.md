### What I learned

1-Doing this project I learned how to add hover state to svg icon by defining an external svg file with desired behaviors and then applying it to the svg icon's hover state.
```css
element {
  &.hover{
  filter : url("loaction of the external svg file")
  }
}
```

1- Deepening my knowledge about accessibility and bem.
2- Try new features of js.
3- Leaning more about git 
4- Experiment with css properties that I don't use often.
